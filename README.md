# Semantic Analysis of Russian Adverbs with the Meaning of Futility by Machine Learning Methods

## Abstract
This study explores the semantics and contextual usage of adverbs with the meaning of futility in Russian discourse using machine learning (ML) methods, specifically classification. The research aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the structure of the aforementioned semantic field, as well as to identify the contextual distribution of the lexical units in question. Through the collection and markup of relevant texts, the study will train classifiers to find correlations among marking parameters and lexical units. The findings are expected to contribute to a more accurate understanding of the semantic field and shed light on the principles governing the interaction between various factors influencing the selection of appropriate synonyms.
